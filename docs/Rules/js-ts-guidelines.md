# ts-js-guidelines

- Prefer pure functions and module composition over classes.
- Use named functions unless infeasible.
- Prefer 'unknown' over 'any' for vague types.
- No type casting or ES6 classes without explicit permission.
- Always use const or let for variables, never 'var'.
- Prefer using nullish coalescing operator (`??`) instead of a logical or (`||`), as it is a safer operator.
